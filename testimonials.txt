“Dan is outstanding to say the least. He comes up with brilliant,
 creative, simple solutions to solve complex problems (which saves you
 money!). He understands internet marketing and internet business so he
 can build programs that are incredibly useful to you. He knows how to
 "think ahead" when programming to allow expandability, scalability and
 reliability to all the programs he designs (so you are not re-designing
 programs from scratch in 6 months when you want to change a feature -
 which is so common with developers! - but NOT Dan!).
 Developers/Programmers like Dan are 1 in 1000. If you hire him, hang
 onto him, because you have a true gem!”
